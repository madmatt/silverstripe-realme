# RealMe module for SilverStripe

## Using the built-in templates

In order to help developers integrating this module with an existing website, the module
provides templates that can be used.

When the module is installed, a new authenticator is registered which allows the login form
to show a template for RealMe login.

RealMe have some strict rules for how you present the RealMe login functionality, please see
the instructions in the RealMe Shared Workspace for complete details.

Along with the standard large-form login forms, there is also a 'mini' login form, suitable 
for use in the header and footer of websites. This can be included by adding a method to your 
normal Page_Controller that returns a `new RealMeMiniLoginForm($this, __FUNCTION__);`. This 
form uses `GET` rather than `POST`, so is an extension of the normal login form. This bypasses
the requirement to go to `Security/login`, so is only useful when it is the only method of 
login to a website.

Further documentation on using these templates can be found in the template files themselves:
[RealMeLoginForm.ss](../../templates/Includes/RealMeLoginForm.ss) and
[RealMeLoginForm_secondary.ss](../../templates/Includes/RealMeLoginForm_secondary.ss).
