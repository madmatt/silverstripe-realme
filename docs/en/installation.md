# Installation of the RealMe module

The module is best installed via Composer by running the below command:

```bash
composer require silverstripe/realme dev-master
```

After composer installation, you need to modify your `.htaccess` file in your web-root, in order to allow access to the 
SimpleSAMLphp web-root - normally this is not allowed as it's within the 'vendor' directory, however SimpleSAMLphp 
requires this.

Normally, you'd have something like the following:
```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	SetEnv HTTP_MOD_REWRITE On
	RewriteEngine On

	# Enable HTTP Basic authentication workaround for PHP running in CGI mode
	RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

	# Deny access to potentially sensitive files and folders
	RewriteRule ^vendor(/|$) - [F,L,NC]
	RewriteRule silverstripe-cache(/|$) - [F,L,NC]
	RewriteRule composer\.(json|lock) - [F,L,NC]

	# Redirect legacy index.php requests
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(?:(.*)/)?index\.php [NC]
	RewriteRule ^index\.php(?:/(.*))?$ %1/$1 [R=301,L]

	# Process through SilverStripe if no file with the requested name exists.
	# Pass through the original path as a query parameter, and retain the existing parameters.
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.*)$
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteRule .* framework/main.php?url=%1 [QSA]
</IfModule>
```

Just prior to the 'vendor' lines above, insert the following:
```
	# Allow access to SimpleSAMLphp directory within vendor/
	RewriteRule ^vendor/madmatt/simplesamlphp/www - [L,NC]
```

Once installation is completed, configuration is required before this module will work. See the 
[configuration section](configuration.md) for full details.
